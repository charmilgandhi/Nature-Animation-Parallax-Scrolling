**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** are an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. It's a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including CSS, DOM and JavaScript. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.

Compared to classic bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality.
